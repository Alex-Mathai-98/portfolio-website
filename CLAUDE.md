### Some project **independent** instructions to CLAUDE - to make it a better coding partner

> **purpose** – This file is the onboarding manual for every AI assistant (Claude, Cursor, GPT, etc.) and every human who edits this repository.
> It encodes our coding standards, guard-rails, and workflow tricks so the *human 30 %* (architecture, tests, domain judgment) stays in human hands.[^1]

Always run the prelude.sh file - it helps in setting up the correct environment.

## 1. Non-negotiable golden rules

| #:  | AI *may* do                                                                                                                                                                       | AI *must NOT* do                                                                                                                                     |

| G-1 | Whenever unsure about something that's related to the project, ask the developer for clarification before making changes.                                                         | ❌ Write changes or use tools when you are not sure about something project-specific, or if you don't have context for a particular feature/decision. |
| G-2 | Generate code **only inside** relevant source directories (e.g., `src/*.py`) or explicitly pointed files.                                                                         | ❌ Modify `tests/`, `SPEC.md`, or other test/spec files (humans own tests & specs).                                                                   |
| G-3 | Add/update **`AIDEV-NOTE:` anchor comments** near non-trivial edited code.                                                                                                        | ❌ Delete or mangle existing `AIDEV-` comments.                                                                                                       |
| G-4 | Follow lint/style configs (`pyproject.toml`, `.ruff.toml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`). Use the project's configured linter, if available, instead of manually re-formatting code. | ❌ Re-format code to any other style.                                                                                                                 |
| G-5 | For changes >300 LOC or >3 files, **ask for confirmation**.                                                                                                                       | ❌ Refactor large modules without human guidance.                                                                                                     |
| G-6 | Stay within the current task context. Inform the dev if it'd be better to start afresh.                                                                                           | ❌ Continue work from a prior prompt after "new task" – start a fresh session.                                                                        |

## 2. Coding standards

* **Python**: 3.12+ recommended. Use `async/await` where appropriate (e.g., in web frameworks such as FastAPI).
* **Formatting**: `ruff` enforces 96-char lines, double quotes, sorted imports. Standard `ruff` linter rules.
* **Typing**: Strict (Pydantic v2 models preferred); `from __future__ import annotations`.
* **Naming**: `snake_case` (functions/variables), `PascalCase` (classes), `SCREAMING_SNAKE` (constants).
* **Error Handling**: Typed exceptions; context managers for resources.
* **Documentation**: Google-style docstrings for public functions/classes.
* **Testing**: Separate test files matching source file patterns.

**Error handling patterns**:

* Use typed, hierarchical exceptions defined in `exceptions.py`.
* Catch specific exceptions, not general `Exception`.
* Use context managers for resources (database connections, file handles).
* For async code, use `try/finally` to ensure cleanup.

Example:

```python
from project.exceptions import ValidationError

async def process_data(data: dict) -> Result:
    try:
        # Process data
        return result
    except KeyError as e:
        raise ValidationError(f"Missing required field: {e}") from e
```

## 3. Anchor comments

Add specially formatted comments throughout the codebase, where appropriate, for yourself as inline knowledge that can be easily `grep`ped for.

### Guidelines:

* Use `AIDEV-NOTE:`, `AIDEV-TODO:`, or `AIDEV-QUESTION:` (all-caps prefix) for comments aimed at AI and developers.
* Keep them concise (≤ 120 chars).
* **Important:** Before scanning files, always first try to **locate existing anchors** `AIDEV-*` in relevant subdirectories.
* **Update relevant anchors** when modifying associated code.
* **Do not remove `AIDEV-NOTE`s** without explicit human instruction.
* Make sure to add relevant anchor comments whenever a file or piece of code is:

  * too long, or
  * too complex, or
  * very important, or
  * confusing, or
  * could have a bug unrelated to the task you are currently working on.

Example:

```python
# AIDEV-NOTE: perf-hot-path; avoid extra allocations (see project ADRs/design docs)
async def render_feed(...):
    ...
```

---

## 4. Commit discipline

* **Granular commits**: One logical change per commit.
* **Tag AI-generated commits**: e.g., `feat: optimise feed query [AI]`.
* **Clear commit messages**: Explain the *why*; link to issues/ADRs if architectural.
* **Use `git worktree`** for parallel/long-running AI branches (e.g., `git worktree add ../wip-foo -b wip-foo`).
* **Review AI-generated code**: Never merge code you don't understand.

---

## 5. Directory-Specific AGENTS.md Files

* **Always check for `AGENTS.md` files in specific directories** before working on code within them. These files contain targeted context.
* If a directory's `AGENTS.md` is outdated or incorrect, **update it**.
* If you make significant changes to a directory's structure, patterns, or critical implementation details, **document these in its `AGENTS.md`**.
* If a directory lacks a `AGENTS.md` but contains complex logic or patterns worth documenting for AI/humans, **suggest creating one**.

---

## 6. Meta: Guidelines for updating AGENTS.md files

### Elements that would be helpful to add:

1. **Decision flowchart**: A simple decision tree for "when to use X vs Y" for key architectural choices would guide my recommendations.
2. **Reference links**: Links to key files or implementation examples that demonstrate best practices.
3. **Domain-specific terminology**: A small glossary of project-specific terms would help me understand domain language correctly.
4. **Versioning conventions**: How the project handles versioning, both for APIs and internal components.

### Format preferences:

1. **Consistent syntax highlighting**: Ensure all code blocks have proper language tags (`python`, `bash`, etc.).
2. **Hierarchical organization**: Consider using hierarchical numbering for subsections to make referencing easier.
3. **Tabular format for key facts**: The tables are very helpful - more structured data in tabular format would be valuable.
4. **Keywords or tags**: Adding semantic markers (like `#performance` or `#security`) to certain sections would help me quickly locate relevant guidance.

## 7. AI Assistant Workflow: Step-by-Step Methodology

When responding to user instructions, the AI assistant (Claude, Cursor, GPT, etc.) should follow this process to ensure clarity, correctness, and maintainability:

1. **Consult Relevant Guidance**: When the user gives an instruction, consult the relevant instructions from `AGENTS.md` files (both root and directory-specific) for the request.
2. **Clarify Ambiguities**: Based on what you could gather, see if there's any need for clarifications. If so, ask the user targeted questions before proceeding.
3. **Break Down & Plan**: Break down the task at hand and chalk out a rough plan for carrying it out, referencing project conventions and best practices.
4. **Trivial Tasks**: If the plan/request is trivial, go ahead and get started immediately.
5. **Non-Trivial Tasks**: Otherwise, present the plan to the user for review and iterate based on their feedback.
6. **Track Progress**: Use a to-do list (internally, or optionally in a `TODOS.md` file) to keep track of your progress on multi-step or complex tasks.
7. **If Stuck, Re-plan**: If you get stuck or blocked, return to step 3 to re-evaluate and adjust your plan.
8. **Update Documentation**: Once the user's request is fulfilled, update relevant anchor comments (`AIDEV-NOTE`, etc.) and `AGENTS.md` files (if used in the project).
9. **User Review**: After completing the task, ask the user to review what you've done, and repeat the process as needed.
10. **Session Boundaries**: If the user's request isn't directly related to the current context and can be safely started in a fresh session, suggest starting from scratch to avoid context confusion.


[^1]: This principle emphasizes human oversight for critical aspects like architecture, testing, and domain-specific decisions, ensuring AI assists rather than fully dictates development.

## Project Overview

Personal portfolio website for Alex Mathai (alexmathai.com), built as a **Jekyll blog** using the **Chirpy theme** (v7.3+). Deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Environment Setup

Always activate the conda environment before running any command:
```bash
source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate jekyll-site
```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Start development server (livereload enabled)
bash tools/run.sh

# Build and test (runs HTML proofer with external links disabled)
bash tools/test.sh

# Manual production build
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build
```

## Architecture

### Theme Override Pattern

The site uses the `jekyll-theme-chirpy` gem. Theme files live inside the gem (find with `bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy`). To customize, copy a theme file into the same local path — local files override gem files.

### Custom Layouts

Two custom layouts override the theme's default `page` layout:
- `_layouts/home.html` — Full-width homepage, removes the right sidebar/TOC
- `_layouts/page-no-sidebar.html` — Same structure as `home.html`, used by tabs like Papers and Resume that need full-width content without sidebar

Both are copies of the Chirpy page layout with the sidebar/TOC column removed.

### Navigation Tabs

Tabs in `_tabs/` use `order:` in front matter to control sidebar ordering. Current tabs:
- `papers.md` (order: 0) — Research papers, uses inline HTML with alternating left/right layouts
- `contact.md` — Contact page
- `resume.md` (order: 4) — Embeds a PDF viewer with mobile fallback

### Content

- Blog posts go in `_posts/` with format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
- `_plugins/posts-lastmod-hook.rb` auto-sets `last_modified_at` from git history
- Resume PDF lives at `assets/pdf/Alex_Mathai_CV2.pdf`
- Self-hosted assets are enabled (`assets.self_host.enabled: true` in config)

### Deployment

Push to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml` which builds with Jekyll, runs `htmlproofer` (external links disabled), and deploys to GitHub Pages. Uses Ruby 3.3.
